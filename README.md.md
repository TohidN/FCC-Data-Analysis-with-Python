This repository contains the code for the five projects I completed for the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) course offered by FreeCodeCamp. These projects provide a solid foundation for anyone interested in learning data analysis techniques using Python.

**Project Descriptions:**
- Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
- Demographic Data Analyzer
- Medical Data Visualizer
- Page View Time Series Visualizer
- Sea Level Predictor

Code is copy lifted. Feel free to explore the code within this repository and learn from these projects!
