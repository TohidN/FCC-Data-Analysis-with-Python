This repository contains the code for the five projects I completed for the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) course offered by FreeCodeCamp. These projects provide a solid foundation for anyone interested in learning data analysis techniques using Python.

**Project Descriptions:**
- [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator)
- [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer)
- [Medical Data Visualizer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer)
- [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer)
- [Sea Level Predictor](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/sea-level-predictor)

Code is copy lifted. Feel free to explore the code within this repository and learn from these projects!
